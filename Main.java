public class Main { //The Main class serves as the entry point for the program.
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MangaList mangaList = new MangaList();  // Create an instance of MangaList

    }
}
//In the main method, an instance of the MangaList class is created and assigned to the mangaList variable.
//The MangaList class is assumed to have a printMangaInfo method that is called on the mangaList object.
//The printMangaInfo method is responsible for displaying manga information, which might include titles, prices, or any other relevant details.
//This code snippet demonstrates a basic usage of the MangaList class by creating an instance and invoking its printMangaInfo method.
